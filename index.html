        Thomas Alva Edison was born in the 11th of February, 1847 in Milan, Ohio.
        He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison and Nancy Matthews Elliott.
        Edison was taught reading writing and arithmetic by his mother, who used to be a school
        teacher. He was a very curious child who used to learn most things by reading on his own.
